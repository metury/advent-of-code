#### Part 1

The first part can be done with aritmetics and matrix `3x3` and not to move out of boundaries.

#### Part 2

In the second part we create a dialpads with boundaries so we never can reach out of it. So when we move we only check if there is empty symbol or not. This is also used for the first part to reuse the code.

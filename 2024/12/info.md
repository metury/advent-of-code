#### Part 1

We will firstly use bucket fill algorithm to find the inner tiles and also the fences with their positions, orientations and sides. After that in the first part we multiple the number of fences with the number of fences.

#### Part 2

In the second part we compare the fences between each other if they are in the same side or not. That is we check the same type values and sort them, after that we will proceed, if the difference is greater than 1 then it is a different side, also always add one for the whole side.

#### Part 1

We actually have the following system of equalities.

\\[
\begin{array}{c c c}
  a_0 x &+ b_0 y  &= p_0 \\
  a_1 x &+ b_1 y  &= p_1 \\
\end{array}
\\]

Which can be simplified to evaluate the following:

\\[
  y = \frac{p_1 a_0 - a_1 p_0}{b_1 a_0 - a_1 b_0}
\\]

\\[
  x = \frac{p_0 - b_0 x}{a_0}
\\]

Lastly we check if it is indeed true.

#### Part 2

In the second part we use the same fact.

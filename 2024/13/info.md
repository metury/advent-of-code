#### Part 1

We actually have the following system of equalities.

\\[
  a_0 x + b_0 y  = p_0
\\]

\\[
  a_1 x + b_1 y = p_1
  \\]

Which can be simplified to evaluate the following:

\\[
  y = \frac{p_1 a_0 - a_1 p_0}{b_1 a_0 - a_1 b_0}
\\]

\\[
  x = \frac{p_0 - b_0 y}{a_0}
\\]

Lastly we check if it is indeed true.

#### Part 2

In the second part we use the same fact.

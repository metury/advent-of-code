#### Part 1

Generally we proceed by recursion. That is we pass the `equation`, `index` and `accumulator`. Then we continue and both use `+` and `*` operations. If we have `accumulator > result` we cut of the computation.

#### Part 2

In the second part we only add `concat(int, int) int` function. Today I also implement it with `goroutines`.

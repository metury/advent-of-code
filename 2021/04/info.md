#### Part 1

In the first part we iterate over the numbers and fill in the bingo cards and check if it is winning, if so compute the value and multiply it by the drawn number.

#### Part 2

In the second part use the same procedure, only cycle through the winning boards, since multiple boards can win in with the same number.

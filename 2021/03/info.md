#### Part 1

In the first part we compute gamma and epsilon by computing number of ones. This determines the most significant bit among all lines. Then we compute the number from such binary representation.

#### Part 2

In the second part we also compute the most significant bit and filter lines. Then get the number from binary representation and multiply both cases.

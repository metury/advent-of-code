#### Part 1

In the first part we go though the characters. If they are opening add them to the stack and if it is closing one check the top of the stack and either return the value of the bracket or continue.

#### Part 2

For the second part if the previous procedure did not exited we pop characters one by one and compute the sum, then we collect all sums and sort them to find the middle one.

#### Part 1

We setup an array of lanternfish based on their days until new reproduction cycle starts. Then we add the number of lanternfish which will reproduce to the end and also to the reset index. We will run this for `80` days.

#### Part 2

We use the same simulation, only run it for `256` days.

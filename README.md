# [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/)

Some of my solutions to advent of code.

This repo is separated firstly by years, then by days. Always inputs are read from the file `INPUT` in the respected folder for that day.

### Scripts

- `page.sh` Is for generating pages for jekyll.
- `rust-templ.sh` takes three arguments `year` `day` `name` and it will create new rust project.

Note some other templates may follow.

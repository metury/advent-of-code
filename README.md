> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repo is separated firstly by years, then by days. Inputs are read from `INPUT` file in the respected folder. There may be optional `info.md` to give information about the solution.

> [!TIP]
> ### Scripts
>
> - `page.sh` is for generating pages for jekyll. Also takes one optional argument where to copy the generated files.
> - `template.sh` is for creating the same rust template for other days. If no argument is given it will create a template for current day otherwise there must be 2 arguments `./template.sh year day`.

# [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/)

Some of my solutions to advent of code.

This repo is separated firstly by years, then by days. Always inputs are read from the file `INPUT` in the respected folder for that day. Also there may be `info.md` file for comenting what is done in the file and it will be parsed to the page script.

### Scripts

- `page.sh` Is for generating pages for jekyll.
- `rust-templ.sh` takes three arguments `year` `day` `name` and it will create new rust project.
- `py-templ.sh` similarly to rust is to creating python template.

Note some other templates may follow.

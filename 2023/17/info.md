#### Part 1

We record every single step by its position, direction, all other possibilities. Then we use heap for the shortest paths and hashmap to record alreeady visited nodes.

#### Part 2

We also introduce a minimal number of nodes in one direction, then we rewrite the code so it can work for both parts.

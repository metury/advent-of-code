#### Part 1

First part was somewhat easy since we only take a look at two dimensional matrix and finc the solution if there is any. After that check the bounds and return right answer.

#### Part 2

In the second part we used [z3](https://docs.rs/z3/latest/z3/) proving system to set the variables and solve the problem.

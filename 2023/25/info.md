#### Part 1

The first part is done by [graphviz dot language](https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html). So the code creates a file `graph.dot` than you run `dot -Kneato -Tsvg graph.dot -o graph.svg`. You find the three pairs forming the min cut and manually insert it into the code. Then you ran the code again.

The alternate algorithm is to use [Karger-Steins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karger%27s_algorithm) approximation algorithm. This I didn't make.

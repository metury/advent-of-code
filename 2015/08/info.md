#### Part 1

In the first part we will replace all `\"`, `\x27` and `\\` as a single characters, to be honest we may choose arbitrarily. We also subtract two for both `"` at the end and begining.

#### Part 2

For the second part we replace all `"` and `\` symbols by two characters and again get the length. And add 2 for `"`.

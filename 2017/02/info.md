#### Part 1

In the first part we use iterations. We compute the maximums and minimums. After that we zip those together and find the subtraction and sum it up.

#### Part 2

In the second part we go through all posibilities and test if they are divisible or not. If they are add the division to the total and break the loop for the line.
